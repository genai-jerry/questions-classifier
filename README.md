<b>About the code</b><br>
This is a sample program that loads a question paper in PDF format and classifies the questions within them based on certain classification parameters.

TODO:
- Enhance chapter classification code to make use of LLM

BUGS:
- PDF contains Hindi text and the output still contains some hindi text. It is supposed to have only English questions
